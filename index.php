           I used PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL, XML, and AJAX to design and develop an online application. A guestbook, a simple calculator, and further course assignments are included. Setting up AJAX to retrieve data from my XML Book Finder was the most difficult portion, but it taught me a lot about asynchronous calls and error handling. In order to create a simple, contemporary layout, I also applied custom CSS. This website which I, Mazharul Juniad have designed and built, is intended for learning, experimenting, and honing web programming abilities.
